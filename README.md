# Harmonic-Coordinates-for-Character-Animation

This project was a final project for INF 585 - Computer Animation (2020-2021) course at Ecole Polytechnique de Paris. This project is implementation of the paper by Pushkar Joshi - [Harmonic-Coordinates-for-Character-Animation](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall07/Papers/Joshi07.pdf). 

The details of our implementation are described in the [report](https://github.com/iradab/Harmonic-Coordinates-for-Character-Animation/blob/main/Harmonic_coordinates_report.pdf). 

## Results

In our program, the user is able to introduce the fluids and provide their velocity (fluid's direction and value) through
mouse interaction (by clicking and dragging the mouse). After fluids are introduced by the user, the simulation of the fluid is observed. 
The values of dissipation rate, diffusion constant, 
viscosity can be changed by user in order to create different types of fluid.

In this image different values for viscosity were chosen(0, 10, 100), which results in simulation of different fluids:

It is also possible to introduce several fluids and see their interaction after some time:
